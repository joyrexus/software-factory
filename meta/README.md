Context, paradigm, and commentary surrounding the software factory concept.

In late 2024, multiple teams working independently reported a shift in agentic coding workflows: models appeared to compound correctness rather than error. Three intellectual lineages — compound engineering, agent-native development, and the software factory vision — converged on a shared formula: **Seed → Validation → Feedback Loop**, fueled by tokens. This section explores what that convergence means, where the concept comes from, what remains unproven, and how the broader community is responding.

[META.md](META.md) frames the moment and distills the formula. [PARADIGM.md](PARADIGM.md) traces the three lineages — Larson's insight that agent quality depends on the engineering environment, Factory.ai's specification discipline for non-human workers, and StrongDM's radical implementation where agents produce and review code autonomously. [QUESTIONS.md](QUESTIONS.md) surfaces the hard design constraints: how to verify agent-written code when agents also write the tests, whether the economics hold at $1,000/day in token costs, and what "readiness" really means — not feature checklists but proving loops that make correctness demonstrable. [maturity-model.md](maturity-model.md) extracts Factory.ai's Agent Readiness Model into a standalone assessment framework with five maturity levels and nine technical pillars. [CONVERSATION.md](CONVERSATION.md) captures community perspectives, counterarguments, and experience reports from practitioners engaging with these ideas.
