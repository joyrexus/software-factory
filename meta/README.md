# Meta

Context, paradigm, and commentary surrounding the software factory concept.

In late 2024, multiple teams working independently reported a shift in agentic coding workflows: models appeared to compound correctness rather than error. Three intellectual lineages — compound engineering, agent-native development, and the software factory vision — converged on a shared formula: **Seed → Validation → Feedback Loop**, fueled by tokens. This section explores what that convergence means, where the concept comes from, what remains unproven, and how the broader community is responding.

- **[The moment and the formula](meta.md)** — frames the convergence and distills the shared insight across all three lineages
- **[Three lineages](paradigm.md)** — traces compound engineering (Klaassen), agent-native development (Factory.ai), and the software factory vision (StrongDM) to their common destination
- **[Honest questions](questions.md)** — surfaces hard design constraints: provability of agent-written code, token economics at $1,000/day, and what "readiness" really means — not feature checklists but proving loops
- **[Agent-native engineering](agent-native/README.md)** — the principle in practice: background agents, case studies from Ramp and Stripe, the maturity framework for evaluating readiness, and a [catalog of adoptable practices](agent-native/practices/README.md)
- **[The conversation](conversation.md)** — community perspectives, counterarguments, and experience reports from practitioners engaging with these ideas
- **[Takeaways for engineering leaders](takeaways.md)** — practical synthesis: what the evidence says, what has to change, and where to start
