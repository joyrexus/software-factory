# The Conversation

In late 2024, multiple teams working independently reported a shift in agentic coding workflows: models appeared to compound correctness rather than error. Three intellectual lineages converged on a shared formula — **Seed → Validation → Feedback Loop**, fueled by tokens — raising questions about what it means, what infrastructure it requires, what remains unproven, and how the broader community is responding.

For the full framing, see the [meta overview](README.md). For specific threads:

- **[The moment and the formula](meta.md)** — the convergence and the shared insight
- **[Three lineages](paradigm.md)** — compound engineering, agent-native development, and the software factory vision
- **[Honest questions](questions.md)** — provability, token economics, and what readiness really means
- **[Agent Readiness Model](agent-native/maturity-model.md)** — five maturity levels, ten technical pillars
- **[Agent-native engineering](agent-native/README.md)** — background agents, case studies, and the maturity framework
