# Three Lineages

Three intellectual threads appear to converge on a similar destination, each from a different starting point.

**Compound Engineering.** Agent output quality depends more on your engineering environment than on agent sophistication. The framework — plan, work, review, and crucially *compound* knowledge back into the system — turns the insight that "your codebase determines agent quality" into an operational discipline. The key innovation is the Compound step: having agents summarize learnings into structured formats that future planning phases consult, creating feedback loops that improve every subsequent iteration. (Larson, [Compound Engineering](https://lethain.com/everyinc-compound-engineering/))

**Agent-Native Development.** Standard development practices are human-centric by design. Agents don't need stand-ups, they need precise specifications. They don't benefit from open-ended tickets, they need small scopes with objective verification criteria. The central insight is a self-check heuristic for specifications: can you identify where the agent begins reading and what artifact proves completion? If either answer is unclear, you're still brainstorming, not specifying. (Factory.ai, [Agent-Native Development](https://www.factory.ai/news/build-with-agents))

**The Software Factory.** The most radical implementation takes the position that "code must not be written by humans; code must not be reviewed by humans." The approach includes digital twin universes — behavioral clones of third-party services for validation — and probabilistic satisfaction metrics that measure what fraction of observed trajectories through scenarios likely satisfy the user. Where others describe principles, this describes a running system. (StrongDM, [Software Factory](https://factory.strongdm.ai/))

Each provides part of the picture. Together they outline an emerging paradigm.
