# Principles

Principles are the assumptions behind the software factory concept. They aren't aspirational slogans — they're the premises the techniques and components depend on. Understanding where you agree or disagree with these is the starting point for evaluating whether the approach fits your organization.

The first four form the core formula: **Seed** &rarr; **Validation** &rarr; **Feedback Loop**, with **Tokens** as the fuel. The remaining three describe the enabling conditions that make the formula viable.

These principles form a connected system. Each depends on and reinforces the others. A factory that embraces the Seed principle but neglects Validation will produce plausible-looking garbage. One that validates rigorously but doesn't Compound Knowledge will repeat the same mistakes at scale.

## Core Formula

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [The Seed](seed.md) | Specification as starting point — quality of seed determines output ceiling |
| [Validation](validation.md) | End-to-end proof of correctness, close to production |
| [The Feedback Loop](feedback-loop.md) | Output fed back as input until convergence — compounding correctness |
| [Tokens as Fuel](tokens-as-fuel.md) | Token economics as planning variable, not sunk cost |

## Enabling Conditions

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Deliberate Naivete](deliberate-naivete.md) | Questioning inherited constraints — what was absurd is now routine |
| [Compound Knowledge](compound-knowledge.md) | Organizational learning at machine speed |
| [Agent-Native Environment](agent-native-environment.md) | Designing environments for non-human workers |
