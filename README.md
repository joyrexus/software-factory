# So You Want to Build a Software Factory

## The Moment

In late 2024, something shifted. Long-horizon agentic coding workflows — the kind where an LLM writes code, runs tests, reads errors, and iterates — crossed an inflection point. Models began compounding correctness instead of error. A coding agent could work for thirty minutes, an hour, longer, and the code kept getting *better* rather than drifting into hallucinated nonsense. Multiple organizations, working independently, arrived at the same conclusion: the "dark factory" — where agents produce code, agents review code, and humans architect systems and validate outcomes — was no longer science fiction. It was an engineering challenge.

This knowledge base is for software architects who've moved past "should we use AI for coding?" and are now asking a harder question: *what does an organization look like when agents do most of the coding?*

## Three Lineages

Three intellectual threads are converging on the same destination, each from a different starting point.

**Compound Engineering.** Will Larson argues that agent output quality depends more on your engineering environment than on agent sophistication. His framework — plan, work, review, and crucially *compound* knowledge back into the system — turns the insight that "your codebase determines agent quality" into an operational discipline. The key innovation is the Compound step: having agents summarize learnings into structured formats that future planning phases consult, creating feedback loops that improve every subsequent iteration.

**Agent-Native Development.** Factory.ai observes that standard development practices are human-centric by design. Agents don't need stand-ups, they need precise specifications. They don't benefit from open-ended tickets, they need small scopes with objective verification criteria. Their framework centers on a self-check heuristic for specifications: can you identify where the agent begins reading and what artifact proves completion? If either answer is unclear, you're still brainstorming, not specifying.

**The Software Factory.** StrongDM presents the most radical implementation: "code must not be written by humans; code must not be reviewed by humans." Their approach includes digital twin universes — behavioral clones of third-party services for validation — and probabilistic satisfaction metrics that measure what fraction of observed trajectories through scenarios likely satisfy the user. Where others describe principles, StrongDM describes a running system.

Each provides part of the picture. Together they describe a complete paradigm.

## The Formula

The shared insight, distilled across all three lineages:

> **Seed** &rarr; **Validation** &rarr; **Feedback Loop**. **Tokens** are the fuel.

Every specification is a **seed** — the quality of the starting input determines the ceiling of the output. Larson's Plan step, Factory.ai's self-check heuristic, and StrongDM's scenario-driven specs all converge here. Every run must end with **validation** — proof the output works, close to production, using end-to-end scenarios rather than narrow unit tests. Every validated output feeds back as input for the next iteration, creating a **feedback loop** that compounds correctness. And the entire system runs on **tokens** — a variable-cost, predictable-output fuel source that replaces fixed-cost engineering headcount.

The question is not whether this formula works. The question is what infrastructure you need to make it reliable.

## The Honest Questions

Simon Willison's [assessment](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/) of the Software Factory concept provides essential design constraints disguised as skepticism.

How do you prove agent-written code works when both the implementation and the tests are generated by agents? This is, as Willison frames it, potentially the most consequential question in software development right now. StrongDM's answer — scenario-based holdout sets evaluated by independent judges — is the most impressive element, but it remains an open problem. What about the economics? StrongDM reports $1,000/day in token costs per engineer. At $20,000/month overhead, the value proposition depends entirely on output velocity exceeding that of human engineers by a wide margin. And what happens to competitive moats when any organization can clone features in hours?

These aren't objections. They're the problems that the [principles](principles/INDEX.md), [techniques](techniques/INDEX.md), and [components](components/INDEX.md) in this knowledge base must solve.

## The Conversation

This is an active, evolving conversation in the engineering community — not settled doctrine. The ideas here are being debated, extended, and challenged in real time by practitioners building real systems.
