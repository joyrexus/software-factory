# The Software Factory Thesis

Several teams have reported that agentic coding workflows — where LLMs write, test, and iterate on code autonomously — can [compound correctness](meta/meta.md) rather than error.

Three [intellectual threads](meta/paradigm.md) appear to converge on a shared pattern:

> **Seed** → **Validation** → **Feedback Loop**

…fueled by **tokens**.

That said, there are [hard questions](meta/questions.md) to ask about this approach.

- **[Principles](principles/README.md)** — The assumptions behind the software factory concept. Seven principles covering specification, validation, feedback, economics, and environment design.
- **[Techniques](techniques/README.md)** — Repeatable patterns to evaluate and adopt. Ten techniques for environment construction, workflow design, and knowledge management.
- **[Components](components/README.md)** — Infrastructure a software factory would need. Deep-dive on the Attractor pipeline orchestrator, plus architectural stubs for context stores and agent identity systems.
