# So You Want to Build a Software Factory

Agentic coding crossed an inflection point — models now [compound correctness](META.md) instead of error. Three [intellectual threads](PARADIGM.md) converge on one [formula](META.md#the-formula): Seed → Validation → Feedback Loop, fueled by tokens. The [hard questions](QUESTIONS.md) remain open. The [conversation](CONVERSATION.md) is live.

- **[Meta](META.md)** — The moment, the paradigm, and the formula behind the software factory concept.
- **[Principles](principles/INDEX.md)** — The beliefs you must hold for a software factory to make sense. Seven principles covering specification, validation, feedback, economics, and environment design.
- **[Techniques](techniques/INDEX.md)** — Repeatable patterns you can adopt. Ten techniques for environment construction, workflow design, and knowledge management.
- **[Components](components/INDEX.md)** — Infrastructure a software factory needs. Deep-dive on the Attractor pipeline orchestrator, plus architectural stubs for context stores and agent identity systems.
- **[Implementations](implementations/INDEX.md)** — People are building this now. Known implementations applying these principles in real projects.
