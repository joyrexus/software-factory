# Techniques

Techniques are repeatable patterns you can adopt in your own engineering organization. Unlike principles (which are beliefs), techniques are practices — concrete things you can implement and measure.

They cluster into three domains:

## Environment

Patterns for building infrastructure that agents work within.

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Digital Twin Universe](digital-twin-universe.md) | Behavioral clones of third-party services for validation |
| [Filesystem as Memory](filesystem-as-memory.md) | Disk as agent cognition substrate — directories as namespaces, INDEX files as navigation |
| [Risk-Tiered Automation](risk-tiered-automation.md) | Graduated autonomy levels: low, medium, and high risk action tiers |
| [Codebase Indexing](codebase-indexing.md) | Organization-wide code search, navigation, and impact analysis |

## Workflow

Patterns for structuring how agents do work.

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Shift Work](shift-work.md) | Separating interactive (needs human) from non-interactive (fully specified) modes |
| [Specification Discipline](specification-discipline.md) | The self-check heuristic for writing agent-ready specifications |
| [Scenarios Not Tests](scenarios-not-tests.md) | Holdout-set validation replacing narrow unit tests |

## Knowledge

Patterns for capturing, transferring, and compressing knowledge.

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Gene Transfusion](gene-transfusion.md) | Cross-codebase pattern transfer via working exemplars |
| [Semport](semport.md) | Semantically-aware code migration between languages and frameworks |
| [Pyramid Summaries](pyramid-summaries.md) | Reversible multi-level context compression |
