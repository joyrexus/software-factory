# Software Factory Knowledge Base — Table of Contents

This is the master index for the knowledge base. Every file in the project is reachable from here through section indexes.

**Start here:** [README.md](README.md) — The Software Factory Thesis

## [Principles](principles/INDEX.md)

The assumptions behind the software factory concept. Seven principles forming a connected system.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [seed.md](principles/seed.md) | Specification as starting point — quality of seed determines output ceiling |
| [validation.md](principles/validation.md) | End-to-end proof of correctness, close to production |
| [feedback-loop.md](principles/feedback-loop.md) | Output fed back as input until convergence — compounding correctness |
| [tokens-as-fuel.md](principles/tokens-as-fuel.md) | Token economics as planning variable, not sunk cost |
| [deliberate-naivete.md](principles/deliberate-naivete.md) | Questioning inherited constraints — what was absurd is now routine |
| [compound-knowledge.md](principles/compound-knowledge.md) | Organizational learning at machine speed |
| [agent-native-environment.md](principles/agent-native-environment.md) | Designing environments for non-human workers |

## [Techniques](techniques/INDEX.md)

Repeatable patterns to evaluate and adopt, clustered by domain: environment, workflow, and knowledge management.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [digital-twin-universe.md](techniques/digital-twin-universe.md) | Behavioral clones of third-party services for validation |
| [gene-transfusion.md](techniques/gene-transfusion.md) | Cross-codebase pattern transfer via exemplars |
| [filesystem-as-memory.md](techniques/filesystem-as-memory.md) | Disk as agent cognition substrate |
| [shift-work.md](techniques/shift-work.md) | Separating interactive from non-interactive agent modes |
| [semport.md](techniques/semport.md) | Semantically-aware code migration between languages/frameworks |
| [pyramid-summaries.md](techniques/pyramid-summaries.md) | Reversible multi-level context compression |
| [scenarios-not-tests.md](techniques/scenarios-not-tests.md) | Holdout-set validation replacing unit tests |
| [specification-discipline.md](techniques/specification-discipline.md) | The self-check heuristic for specifications |
| [risk-tiered-automation.md](techniques/risk-tiered-automation.md) | Graduated autonomy levels for agent actions |

## [Components](components/INDEX.md)

Infrastructure a software factory would need. Three architectural roles the concept implies.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [attractor/](components/attractor/INDEX.md) | Pipeline orchestrator — DOT-based graph engine for multi-agent workflows (56-file deep-dive) |
| [context-store/](components/context-store/INDEX.md) | Persistent structured memory for agents — DAG structure, deduplication, query patterns |
| [agent-identity/](components/agent-identity/INDEX.md) | Auth/authz for mixed human-agent workforce — federated identity, audit trails |

## [Implementations](implementations/INDEX.md)

Known implementations applying these ideas.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [kilroy.md](implementations/kilroy.md) | Dan Shapiro's Kilroy — local-first software factory CLI |
