# The Honest Questions

Simon Willison's [assessment](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/) of the Software Factory concept provides essential design constraints disguised as skepticism.

How do you prove agent-written code works when both the implementation and the tests are generated by agents? This is, as Willison frames it, potentially the most consequential question in software development right now. StrongDM's answer — scenario-based holdout sets evaluated by independent judges — is the most impressive element, but it remains an open problem. What about the economics? StrongDM reports $1,000/day in token costs per engineer. At $20,000/month overhead, the value proposition depends entirely on output velocity exceeding that of human engineers by a wide margin. And what happens to competitive moats when any organization can clone features in hours?

These aren't objections. They're the problems that the [principles](principles/INDEX.md), [techniques](techniques/INDEX.md), and [components](components/INDEX.md) in this knowledge base must solve.
