# Attractor — Pipeline Orchestrator

A comprehensive knowledge base produced from a systematic review of StrongDM's [Attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor) specification — the DOT-based pipeline orchestrator at the heart of the [Software Factory](https://factory.strongdm.ai/) concept.

This is one component within the broader [software factory knowledge base](../../README.md). For the full picture — principles, techniques, and other components — start at the [root](../../README.md).

## How This Discovery Was Produced

This knowledge base was generated through a deep review of:

- **[attractor-spec.md](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor/blob/main/attractor-spec.md)** — The DOT-based pipeline orchestrator
- **[coding-agent-loop-spec.md](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor/blob/main/coding-agent-loop-spec.md)** — The programmable coding agent library
- **[unified-llm-spec.md](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor/blob/main/unified-llm-spec.md)** — The provider-agnostic LLM client
- **[factory.strongdm.ai](https://factory.strongdm.ai/)** — Principles, techniques, and products describing the Software Factory vision

Content was extracted, decomposed by topic, and organized into a navigable hierarchy using Claude Code as the research and authoring agent.
