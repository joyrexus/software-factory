# Implementations

People are building this now.

The principles, techniques, and components described in this knowledge base aren't theoretical — they're being implemented in real projects by practitioners who are navigating the same questions. This section catalogs known implementations of the software factory concept, from full-stack platforms to focused tools.

This is a living list, expected to grow as more projects emerge and existing ones mature.
